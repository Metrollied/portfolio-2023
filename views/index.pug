    h1 Welcome!
    p 
      | After six years teaching Mathematics to secondary school children I decided to delve into a long standing interest of mine - development. After conquering online courses and escaping the nine circles of tutorial hell, I chose to leave teaching behind (mostly!) and start a new career as a developer.
      br
      br
      | Four years ago I began my quest, working through HTML and CSS to JavaScript, and into some of it's frameworks, including React, and on to creating full-stack apps using the MERN stack with Node.
      br
      br
      | In January 2023 I began my first role outside of teaching as a Junior Web Developer at LiveBuzz, a large events company that creates registration websites for corporate events. Then sixteen months later I began working for Cake Agency, an eCommerce agency based in Birmingham, and have grown there as a Full Stack Developer.
